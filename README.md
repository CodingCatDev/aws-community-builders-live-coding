# AWS Community Builders Live Coding
## Alex Bio
I’m the founder of [CodingCatDev](https://codingcat.dev), where we create “Purrfect Web Tutorials” to teach the world how to turn their development dreams into reality. I am a professional full stack developer, and I am passionate about mentoring new developers and helping the community that has allowed me to live my development dreams. I firmly believe that anyone can learn to be a developer. The CodingCatDev team is here to help! 

## AWS Community Builders - Code Together

### Why

It is hard to work in a silo. Paired programming is a thing for a reason. Each of us have special skills and different experiences. This format allows us to learn from each other and help each other solve problems together.

### How

We will set up a StreamYard broadcast each week so that the community can be directly involved and able to interact with each other. We can also code together using [Visual Studio Code Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share) this way each person can get their hands on a keyboard and help. Allowing guest coders to come on and share their knowledge and skills.

### When

We are still working on this but for now 12pm EST (5pm GMT).

### Where

You will be able to watch and make comments Live on both: \
YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/c/codingcatdev](https://www.youtube.com/c/codingcatdev)
Twitch: [https://www.twitch.tv/codingcatdev](https://www.twitch.tv/codingcatdev)

### Topics

For this pilot phase I am going to focus on Amplify. We will work on this and have a system built out where we can have signups and voting for a topic each week. If there is enough demand we can do this more often.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
